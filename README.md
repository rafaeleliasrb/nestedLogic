# Hackerrank problem Nested Logic

<p align="justify">
This is a simple problem whose objective is <i>"puts your understanding of nested conditional statements to the test"</i>.
However, although easy to solve, the solution can be confusing if we don't use good programming techniques.
This situation is common in our work, when we wrote complicated solutions to problems that seemed simple.</p>

This is not related to the beauty of the code, beauty is something relative, but the ease of understanding the code because a certainty we have in the programmer's life is that the code will have changes and the more complicated to understand the code the more time will be spent to change it.</p>

In this post we will make three different solutions to the problem and discuss what the improvements are in relation to each other.
